Available Algorithms
====================

nbodykit includes several state-of-the-art implementations of canonical
algorithms in the field of large-scale structure. It includes functionality
for computing a wide variety of clustering statistics on data, as well as
algorithms for finding groups of objects.

We describe these algorithms in detail below, and users can also
find further examples in :ref:`cookbook` section of the documentation.
